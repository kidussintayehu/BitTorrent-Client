# Bit Torrent Client 

BitTorrent is a protocol for downloading and distributing files across the Internet. It is a peer-to-peer protocol because users of the BitTorrent network, known as peers, download data in parts from one another. Peers are introduced to one another by trackers, which are central servers.

A .torrent file contains instructions on how to connect to a tracker as well as the contents of a torrentable file. It's all we require to get the torrent download process started. We must decode the .torrent file because it is encoded in a Bencode format.
